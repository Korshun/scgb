*Please repost this track to let artists know that groups are back!*

- Comments are automatically checked every two minutes.
- Only the tracks you made are reposted.
- All comments on this track are automatically removed.
- If you try to post an already posted track, it will be bumped to the top.
- A track or playlist won't be bumped/reposed if it was bumped/reposted less than a week ago. The limit is so large because SoundCloud blocks reposts if the same track or playlist is repeatedly unreposted and reposted.
- You cannot make more than 3 posts per 24 hours.

You can repost playlists too! Use them if you want to post multiple tracks.

Put '!' before the link to remove the track or playlist from this group.
